If you follow many users on Github, you may forget what sparked your
interest in each user.

ghf is a tool that fetches the list of people you follow on Github,
allowing you to record an annotation for each followee.

ghf was written in Python 3 and depends on the tkinter package.

== Usage

1. Run `python3 ghf.py`.

2. Enter your username.

3. A window listing your Github followees will appear. Beside each username will be a text box in which you may write a note.

4. Click the Save button to save the list of users along with your annotations to file.

== Configuration

By default, ghf will save your notes to a file in the current directory. To customise this behaviour:

1. Rename ghf.sample.json to ghf.json.

2. Place the file anywhere in your current directory or system path.

3. Modify the values inside the file.

== Type Checking

If you've installed mypy, you can perform type checking by running `python3 -m mypy ghf.py`.
