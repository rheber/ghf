# README

ghf is a tool that gets the list of people you follow on Github. This allows you to, for example, keep notes on them. It's not very impressive at the moment.

## Usage

Run `python ghf.py` and enter your username. A list of your Github followees will appear in a window, along with a Save button which will save the list to file.
